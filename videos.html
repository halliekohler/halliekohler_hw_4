					Rabbit in the Rye presents the second film in 'The Grain, Gold &amp; Gravel Project' series. After some good ol' fashioned water dredging, "I Met My Love" was recorded live in an abandoned water tower in Hamilton, New York.
					<br> 
					The series features five videos filmed in and around their hometown and the surrounding area. Studio and live versions of "I Met My Love" may be found on iTunes and <a href="http://rabbitintherye.bandcamp.com/"> Bandcamp. </a>

					Rabbit in the Rye presents the third film in 'The Grain, Gold &amp; Gravel Project' series. "The Fox &amp; the Farmer" was recorded live in a neighborhood hayloft in Poolville, New York, just a few country miles outside of Hamilton. It was difficult to run the power, the wind kicked up more than a bit of hay, and the chickens downstairs interrupted the song more than once. They still laid the next day. <br>
